## Update from upstream/main (45e64757d â†’ e4485da4f)

### Summary
Major update from upstream Bluesky Social App repository with 590 commits. This update includes a significant Expo SDK upgrade, major dependency updates, and substantial architectural changes that may require careful migration planning for forks.

### Breaking Changes ðŸš¨

#### Expo SDK and React Native Upgrade
- **Expo SDK**: Upgraded from SDK 53 to SDK 54
- **React Native**: Upgraded from 0.79.3 to 0.81.4
- **React/React-DOM**: Upgraded from 19.0.0 to 19.1.0
- **Node.js Requirement**: Bumped from 18.18.2 to 20.19.4
- **Impact**: All Expo modules need to be updated to compatible versions

#### iOS 26 SDK Compatibility Fixes
- **Commit**: `6983efee7` (PR #9059, September 22, 2025)
- **Author**: Samuel Newman
- **Problem**: iOS 26/Xcode 26 introduced breaking changes requiring app compatibility updates
- **Fixes Applied**:
  1. **UIDesignRequiresCompatibility Flag** (`app.config.js`):
     - Added `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility: true` to iOS configuration
     - Enables iOS 26's design compatibility mode
     - Required for apps to properly support iOS 26's new UI design requirements
  2. **AssetsLibrary Deprecation Fix** (`patches/react-native-compressor+1.11.0.patch`):
     - Removed deprecated `import AssetsLibrary` from react-native-compressor
     - AssetsLibrary framework is no longer available in iOS 26/Xcode 26
     - Without this patch: build failures with "failed to build module 'AssetsLibrary'"
     - Related issue: https://github.com/numandev1/react-native-compressor/issues/367
- **Impact**: Forks must apply these changes to build with Xcode 26 for iOS 26 compatibility

#### Environment Configuration
- **Complete Restructuring**: The `.env.example` file has been completely rewritten
- **New Required Variables**:
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_RELEASE_VERSION`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_BLUESKY_PROXY_DID`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_CHAT_PROXY_DID`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`
  - `BAPP_CONFIG_DEV_URL`
- **Impact**: Forks must update their environment configuration

#### Core Component Redesigns
- **Button Component**: Complete redesign - any custom button implementations need migration
- **Dialog System**: Major refactoring of the entire dialog system
- **ALF Design System**: Migrated from internal to external package `@bsky.app/alf`
- **Toast Notifications**: Replaced with Sonner-based system
- **Impact**: Custom components extending these will need updates

#### Removed Features/APIs
- **Post Thread Query**: Removed `src/state/queries/post-thread.ts`
- **SubtleWebHover**: Removed in favor of unified `SubtleHover`
- **Impact**: Any code depending on these APIs needs refactoring

### Migration Guide for Forks

After pulling in these upstream changes, you'll need to:

1. **Update Node.js** to version 20.19.4 or higher (required by Expo SDK 54)
2. **Update Environment Variables**: Review and update your `.env` files to match the new structure
3. **Resolve Merge Conflicts**: 
   - Pay special attention to any custom modifications in components that were redesigned (Button, Dialog, Toast)
   - Check for conflicts in `app.config.js` if you have custom iOS configurations
   - Review any custom patches that might conflict with new patches
4. **Update Fork-Specific Code**:
   - Migrate any code using removed APIs (post-thread queries, SubtleWebHover)
   - Update any custom components extending Button, Dialog, or Toast systems
   - Ensure any fork-specific features are compatible with the new ALF design system
5. **Reinstall Dependencies**: Run `yarn install` to update all packages
6. **Run Tests**: Verify all functionality works with the new Expo SDK and dependencies
7. **Build and Test on iOS 26**: The iOS 26 compatibility fixes are already included, but verify your fork builds correctly with Xcode 26
